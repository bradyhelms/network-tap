# Inline Network Tap 

This project, developed as part of the Senior Design Project for EEL4920 at Florida International University, focuses on designing an FPGA-based network tap for discreetly copying and modifying network traffic.

## Project Overview

The Inline Network Tap is an FPGA-based solution designed to intercept network traffic without disrupting or alerting the network. The tap captures, copies, and allows modification of the data in real-time, providing valuable capabilities for monitoring, analysis, and security applications.

### Features

* **Real-time Network Traffic Monitoring**: Capture and analyze traffic with minimal latency.
* **Data Modification**: Modify network packets as they pass through the tap.
* **Discreet Operation**: Operates without disrupting the normal flow of network traffic.

### Technologies Used

* FPGA (Field-Programmable Gate Array)
* TCP/IP Networking Protocols
* PetaLinux
* C/C++
* VHDL for hardware design
* Network Traffic Analysis Tools
